# Insight Data Challenges

Towards the end of my fellowship at Insight Data Science, we would have weekly data challenges. I have decided to collect my Jupyter notebooks (and possibly presentations or supplementary materials) here for personal records, and as a resource for individuals who may benefit from reading my code.

Jupyter notebooks may be found in the `notebooks` sub-directory, and many of these come with a link to presentation slides used to explain my findings.
